#Automated Machine Learning Pipeline#
### This application is in development phase ###

1. **Project's Title:** Automated Machine Learning Pipeline WebApp

2. ##Project Description##
The objective of this application is to automate ML workflows and implement AutoML solutions. 

*The pipeline starts with ingesting raw data, which is then engineered to suit algorithm and domain
requirements by leveraging data cleaning and feature engineering techniques. A ML model is then
trained on this data and validated by hyperparameter tuning. The best performing model is then
deployed and used for production.*

*The essence of AutoML is to automate repetitive tasks such as pipeline creation and hyper-parameter 
tuning so that data scientists can spend more time on business problems on hand in practical scenarios.*

###Summarized version: What this application does:###
1. improve efficiency by automatically running repetitive tasks. This allows data scientists to focus more on problems instead of models.
2. Automated ML pipelines also help avoid potential errors caused by manual work.
3. AutoML is a big step toward the democratization of machine learning and allows everyone to use ML features.
4. Create a model, perform stratified cross validation and evaluate classification metrics
5. Automatically tune the hyper-parameters of a classification model
6. Analyze model performance using various plots
7. Finalize the best model at the end of the experiment
8. Make predictions on new / unseen data
9. Save / load a model for future use
