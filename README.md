# Automated Machine Learning Pipeline #
> This application is in development phase 
> 

## Project Description ##
__The objective of this application is to automate ML workflows and implement AutoML solutions.__

* The pipeline starts with ingesting raw data, which is then engineered to suit algorithm and domain
requirements by leveraging data cleaning and feature engineering techniques. A ML model is then
trained on this data and validated by hyperparameter tuning. The best performing model is then
deployed and used for production. *

* The essence of AutoML is to automate repetitive tasks such as pipeline creation and hyper-parameter 
tuning so that data scientists can spend more time on business problems on hand in practical scenarios. *

## What this application does: ##
* improve efficiency by automatically running repetitive tasks. This allows data scientists to focus more on problems instead of models.
* Automated ML pipelines also help avoid potential errors caused by manual work.
* Democratization of machine learning features.
* Create a model, perform stratified cross validation and evaluate classification metrics
* Automatically tune the hyper-parameters of a classification model
* Analyze model performance using various plots
* Finalize the best model at the end of the experiment
* Make predictions on new / unseen data
* Save / load a model for future use
